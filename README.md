### Hello!

I'm Nick LoVallo, a software engineer based in the United States and the Netherlands. I work throughout the full stack in order to create thoughtful and well-structured projects. I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my code, and refining my skills.

I primarily code in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, Java, and Spring Boot, and have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
