### Hello!

I'm Nick LoVallo, a web developer and software engineer based in Chicago. I work throughout the full stack in order to create thoughtful and well-structured projects. I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my code, and refining my skills.

I primarily code in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and Java, and have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
